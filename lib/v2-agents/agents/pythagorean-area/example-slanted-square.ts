// What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
// no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
// Try this: change FAR = 4 to 6: the 3-4-5 triangle is y = -4/3 x + 4, or y = -3/4 x + 3.

// How good is the line y = mx + c for your rule? [main part, tie-breaker]: bigger is better, null is no score.
