# Whole Intercept · Example: prime factors of that whole number
# Main part: y-intercept close to a whole number. Tie-breaker: prime factors of that whole number.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: remove the "stretch" line: is adding as good as multiplying here?


def score(m, c, p):
    # How good is the line y = mx + c for your rule? [main part, tie-breaker]: bigger is better, None is no score.

    main = -abs(c - n)
    f = factors(n)                                  # its prime factors, smallest first
    return [main, len(f)]   # main: how far the y-intercept is from a whole number (closer is better); tie-breaker: more prime factors are better
