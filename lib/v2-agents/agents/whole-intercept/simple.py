# Whole Intercept · Simple
# Main part: y-intercept close to a whole number. Tie-breaker: whichever you were dealt (smallest prime factor of that whole number; prime factors of that whole number).
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: add the seq.step line from the Thorough starter: a third way to change the line.
