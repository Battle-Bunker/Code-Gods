# Triangle Area · Example: legs nearly equal
# Main part: triangle area close to A. Tie-breaker: legs nearly equal.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: change FAR = 4 to 2: smaller changes cost less, but does it still get there?
