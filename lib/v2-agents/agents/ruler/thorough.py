# Ruler · Thorough
# Main part: distance² from (0, 0) close to a square. Tie-breaker: whichever you were dealt (that whole distance; the gradient close to a prime; the triangle's area close to a square).
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: change QUOTES = 20 to 6: fewer prices asked, but it may miss a cheaper plan.
