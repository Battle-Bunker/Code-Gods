# Square Area · Example: that square's root's smallest prime factor
# Main part: area close to a square number. Tie-breaker: that square's root's smallest prime factor.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: add the "stretch" lens from the Thorough starter.
