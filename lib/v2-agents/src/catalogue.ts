/**
 * The one description the shipped agents are generated from (starters.ts): for every rule family, how an agent
 * scores a line y = mx + c itself (its main part and each tie-breaker, in both languages), and which moves can
 * improve each tie-breaker without spoiling the main part. Everything else (reading, trying moves in the agent's own
 * head, pricing the best and making the cheapest) is the same skeleton for every family.
 *
 * Scores mirror lib/v2-linear's families exactly (the starters test checks every one against the engine's evaluation
 * on sampled lines). Lines are read as y = mx + c, so these agents are for the whole-number and fraction boards of
 * one line per object, where every line has a gradient.
