# Main part: the unchanged number close to T. Tie-breaker: |c| close to a prime.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: change FAR = 4 to 8 and see which primes it finds.
