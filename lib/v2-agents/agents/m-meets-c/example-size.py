# m Meets c · Example: they meet at a big number
# Main part: gradient close to the y-intercept. Tie-breaker: they meet at a big number.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: remove the "stretch" line: can turning alone make them meet at a big number?
