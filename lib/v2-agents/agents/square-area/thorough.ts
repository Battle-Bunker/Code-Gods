// Square Area · Thorough
// Main part: triangle area close to a square number. Tie-breaker: whichever you were dealt (prime factors of that square's root; smallest prime factor of that root).
// What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
// no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
// Try this: change QUOTES = 20 to 6: fewer prices asked, but it may miss a cheaper plan.
