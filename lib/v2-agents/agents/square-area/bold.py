# Square Area · Bold
# Main part: area close to a square number. Tie-breaker: whichever you were dealt (that square's root's smallest prime factor; that square's root's largest prime factor; prime factors of that square's root).
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: change FAR = 6 to 3: smaller jumps, cheaper moves.
