# Prime Staircase · Example: the first non-prime term close to a prime
# Main part: a run of different primes from y(0). Tie-breaker: the first non-prime term close to a prime.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: change FAR = 4 to 2: cheaper moves, but does the run still grow?
