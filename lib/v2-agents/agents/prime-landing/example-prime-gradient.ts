// What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
// no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
// Try this: remove the "tilt" line to see how much slower it gets with one lens.

// How good is the line y = mx + c for your rule? [main part, tie-breaker]: bigger is better, null is no score.
