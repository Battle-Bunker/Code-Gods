# Pythagorean Area · Example: the slanted side squared close to a square
# Main part: the area close to A. Tie-breaker: the slanted side squared close to a square.
# What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
# no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
# Try this: change FAR = 4 to 6: the 3-4-5 triangle is y = -4/3 x + 4, or y = -3/4 x + 3.


def score(m, c, p):
    # How good is the line y = mx + c for your rule? [main part, tie-breaker]: bigger is better, None is no score.
    if m == 0 or c == 0:                            # no triangle: the worst score
        return None
    legX, legY = abs(c / m), abs(c)                 # the triangle's base and height
    area = legX * legY / 2
    main = -abs(area - p["A"])
    side2 = legX * legX + legY * legY                # the slanted side, squared
    return [main, -abs(side2 - near(side2, square))]   # main: how far the triangle's area is from A (closer is better); tie-breaker: a slanted side whose square is a square number is better (3, 4, 5)
