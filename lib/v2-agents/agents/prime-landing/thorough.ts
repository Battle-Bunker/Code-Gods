// Prime Landing · Thorough
// Main part: the y-intercept close to a prime. Tie-breaker: whichever you were dealt (that prime; the gradient close to a prime too; y(1) close to a prime too).
// What it does: reads the line once as y = mx + c (a small read), tries changes in its own head (thinking costs
// no energy, only time), keeps the plans that make the line best for your rule, and pays for the cheapest of them.
// Try this: change QUOTES = 20 to 6: fewer prices asked, but it may miss a cheaper plan.

// How good is the line y = mx + c for your rule? [main part, tie-breaker]: bigger is better, null is no score.
